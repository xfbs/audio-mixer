# Audio Mixer

This is me documenting the design and building of my desk four-channel audio
mixer.  You can use this to replicate my results or learn from my mistakes, but
keep in mind that I have no formal training in EE.

## Documentation

The file `doc.tex` contains my writeup of the project. You may want to build
this with LaTeX to generate a PDF. 

The folder `datasheets/` contains datasheets of all the parts discussed in my
writeup for reference.
